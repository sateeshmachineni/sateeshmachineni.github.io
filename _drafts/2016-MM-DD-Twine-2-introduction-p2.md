Twine is an open-source tool for creating interactive, nonlinear fiction.

Twine does not need any code to create a story, but it is very flexible. With Twine, authors can turn stories into games using variables, conditional logic, images, CSS, and JavaScript. It works really well for prototipying too.

Thanks to its gentle learning curve, Twine makes development accessible.

Twine saves stories as html files that work in a browser, and it is easy for authors and developers to share their work with the World.
