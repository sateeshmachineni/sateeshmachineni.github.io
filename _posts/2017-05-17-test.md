This is an answer for an interview i appeared.The question was to optimize below query..Unfortunately their site didn't allow special characters ,so i had to post the answer on my blog and provided  link to them.I felt happy about this answer,so it thought of leaving it like this..


Few issues i could see with above query

1.Where clause is not sargable

so rewriting below clause in query like this

cast(main.c as date) >=cast(getdate()-2 as date)

instead of this

```DATEDIFF(Day, main.c, getdate()-2) <=0 and DATEDIFF(Day, sub.c, getdate()-2) <=0```

helps when we have an index,same is the case with test_sub table where clause

2.UDF executes per row,we can't avoid this,so instead we have to focus on query reqrite which limits the rows

3.below indexes helps the query

```
 create index nci_KC_c_Ic_a_b_e
 on test_main(c)
 include(a,b,e)

  create index nci_KC_c_Ic_a_b
 on test_sub(c)
 include(a,b)
```
Even after adding this indexes,table test_main returns 4000 rows but scans all the table due to this clause

`cast(SUBSTRING(e,6,5) as int)` between 1000 and 5000

adding a filtered index would be of much help,but i cant add due to its limitations,so i added computed column like below

```
alter table test_main
add e_col as cast(SUBSTRING(e,6,5) as int) persisted
```

now with this approach,i got only required rows and i am not paying cost for 50000 reads ,i am paying cost only for 4001 reads

Below are the total queries i ran


```
alter table dbo.test_main
add e_col as cast(SUBSTRING(e,6,5) as int) persisted


 create index nci_KC_e_Ic_a_b_c
 on test_main(e_Col)
include(a,b,c,e)



  create index nci_KC_c_Ic_a_b
 on test_sub(b)
 include(a,c)
 ```

now the query
```
IF (SELECT sum(b) from test_main where a in (select b from test_sub where  DATEDIFF(Day, c, getdate()-2) <=0 )) > 0
select main.c,
dbo.UDF_exists(main.a) as exists_ ,
e,
SUBSTRING(e,6,5)as  sequence_ ,
 cast(1000/sum(main.b)  as decimal(18,2)) as divide_
from  
test_main main
join
test_sub sub
on main.a=sub.b
where  cast(main.c as date) >=cast(getdate()-2 as date)and cast(sub.c as date) >=cast(getdate()-2 as date)
and e_Col >=1000 and e_col<=5000
group by main.c,main.a,main.e,e_col
Else
select null,null,null,null
```

thats pretty much it
