Thank you everyone for 2000 likes on facebook page.This means a lot to me.I am trying to post atleast once in a month,but there are many things 
going on in my life as of now...I will try to post once a month for sure.

I am also trying to upgrade myself  and i found an amazing course [Building a Modern Computer from First Principles](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).I always wanted 
to build an operating system from scratch  and finding this course was a boon.This is a 12 week course and i am at 4th week now and its been 
an amazing journey so far.

I also wanted to take this opportuninty to ask you guys on what you would like to see on this.

Please leave comments on what you would like to see more or take this short [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BDDEa1giduuof3GaHvboLQyNH3igM6yuubH9HB54SNU)


Again thank you guys  and have a nice day
