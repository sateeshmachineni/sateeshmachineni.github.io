I get this question many times,so thought of creating a post about how i learned ..

I found this book  [ T-SQL Fundamentals](https://www.amazon.com/T-SQL-Fundamentals-3rd-Itzik-Ben-Gan/dp/150930200X) to be very helpfull.
[Itzik Ben-Gan](http://tsql.solidq.com/) is worlds renowned expert on TSQL and he also wrote a number of books.
I strongly recommend exploring other books by him

After completing the book ,i started reading [Training Kit (Exam 70-461)](http://tsql.solidq.com/books/tk70461/) by same author.Finally i attempted exam and passed.

In this learning process StackOverflow helped me a lot.I strongly recommend creating an account and start asking questions.I also recommend checking this link prior to asking questions,so that they wont be downvoted
[How to post a T-SQL question on a public forum](https://spaghettidba.com/2015/04/24/how-to-post-a-t-sql-question-on-a-public-forum/)

Also you can download [SQLSERVER community edition](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=SQL%20Server%202016%20Developer) for free here and start practicing


That was pretty much ,how i started learning TSQL.Sharing this in case,it helps some one
