I have finally installed SQLServer on linux..It was good exeperience.Thanks to Microsoft for good documentation..

You can follow below link to install SQLServer 

<kbd><a href ="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup" >Install SQLServer on LINUX</a></kbd>

To query SQLServer on linux,below  are the  options you have as of now 

1.SSMS ,if you are trying to connect from windows  
2.Good old SQLCMD,this can be installed on linux following the steps <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools#ubuntu" style="color: rgb(100, 149, 237)"
Title ="install SQL tools" >here</a>  
3.Vscode

I chose VSCode because,it offered much flexibilty .
All you have to do is,install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux" style="color: rgb(100, 149, 237)"> VSCODE</a> and install MSSQL Extension

Everything went smooth so far,I Will try to  post more on querying Vnext ,when i have time
