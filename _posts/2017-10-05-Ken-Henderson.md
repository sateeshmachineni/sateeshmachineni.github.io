I was trying to setup windbg to explore more about SQLServer internals.My search lead me to this book ,[The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Architecture and Internals](http://www.amazon.in/Gurus-Guide-Server-Architecture-Internals/dp/0201700476/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8)...I was amazed about the quality of the content
and the way it was presented..

I  wanted to know more about the author..Some searches lead me to know ,that he was one of the
co authors of SQLNexus .I just thought of sending a small note of thanks for his books,but i got  to know that [he was no more ](http://www.haidongji.com/2008/02/13/in-memory-of-ken-henderson/)

Ken is truly one of the respected authors and a good human being (which can be seen from his quote below on one of his books) ..

RIP Ken Henderson .

Below is a preface from his book quoted above and i believe it applies to any one in any field.

>There’s a lesson to be learned here, and it has to do with the value of humility. Becoming arrogant and walling yourself off from the “little people” in the world is a fast ticket to stagnation. It’s a good way to stop growing professionally. There are no little people. The world moves too quickly not to learn all you can from whomever you can whenever you can. No matter how long I work in this business, I continue to learn from practically everyone around me—new people and old alike, experienced and inexperienced as well. I have always considered myself lucky to have worked with so many great people over the years.

>No matter who you are, you are never above exchanging a warm greeting or lending a helping hand when you can. People frequently write me or contact me for help, sometimes with the most esoteric of questions, and I do the best I can to assist them. I’ve been where they are, and their requests keep me moving—they keep me on my toes. I’m keenly aware that I owe much of what I’ve learned over the years to the many fine people I’ve had the privilege of coming in contact with, and exchanging a cordial greeting with them or helping them in some small way is the least I can do.

>And you have to remember that there is always someone out there who’s bigger and better. When you work harder at trying to hold other people back than at helping them realize their potential, you make what should be teamwork into a zero-sum game where only one party can win—everyone else, by definition, must lose. Even if you prevail for a time, this sets you up for what I call the aging champion syndrome. Eventually someone will come along that you can’t stop. He’ll be quicker or smarter or more determined than you in some way, and you’ll soon find yourself lying flat on your back, knocked out of the match, staring up at the ref while he shouts out the 10-count, wondering why no one listens to you anymore.
