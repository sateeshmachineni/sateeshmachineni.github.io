I have been trying to complete <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome">NandToTetris</a> Course Part one,and finally completed it due to recent holidays.Taking this course has been extremenly satisfying.
I highly recommend taking this course if you want to understand computer internals and want to thank the Shimon Shocken and Noam Nissan  for their valuable time and effort in creating this course.

You can see my First assembler written in C# <a href="https://github.com/sateeshmachineni/NandToTetrisPart1"> here</a> for Hack computer.
