In Interviews,many things matter and one of them is luck.Luck plays an important role.

Below is my experience with out luck..

**Interviewer**: "What is the main purpose of listener ?"  
**Me**:Listener is used to connect to Primary node .  
**Interviewer**:Is that the only purpose ?   
**Me**:(I thought for some time),yes that's the only reason.   (and she was not satisfied with this)

At the end of the interview,i asked her,what do you think can be other uses for a listener ?

She told me, she is expecting to me answer , you place  listener in config file..

I was blown away by this explanation.

These days you might have to answer exactly what is in interviewers mind and luck plays an important rule.


Best of luck in your interviews
