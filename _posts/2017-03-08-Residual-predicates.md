SQLServer residual predicates also mean the same thing.If you have more than 1 predicate  in a query,SQLServer filters most of the data using
one predicate and uses the second predicate to filter out each row in left over result set ...

Lets do a demo to understand more on this


``` sql

--create a table and fill it with 100 row
create table #test2
(
id int,
name varchar(10)
)
 
insert into #test2
select n ,cast(n as varchar(4))+'a'
from numbers
where n<=100 

```

Let's also create an index on this table

``` sql
create index nci_nmbr_nm on #test2(id,name)

```

Now let's run below query 

``` sql
select  * from #test2 where id=99 and name='99a'
```

Below is the execution plan of that query

<img  src="/img/rs1.PNG"/>

As you can observe,we could see only one predicate

Now let's run below query 

``` sql
select  * from #test2 where id>=99 and name='99a'
```

Below is the execution plan of the query

<img  src="/img/rs2.PNG"/>


As you can see,we have to predicates  

+ Predicate
+  seek predicate

What happened here ..? how to infer this predicates..

SQLServer first did a seek  using `id>=99`.The result set obtained from first predicate is again filtered out using  `name=99a`

Here `99a` is called residual predicate

The impact of residual predicate can be very huge ,if the first predicate is not selective enough.In our case,resiudal predicate had only one row.Imagine  the first predicate(>=99) matched some 1 lakh rows,Now residual predicate(in our case `99a`) had to evaluated against these 1 lakh rows.That would be cubersome and index we have is not worthy.


That's pretty much about residual predicates  .
