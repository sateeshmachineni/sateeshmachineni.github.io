I was long fascinated about internals of computers.<br>
<br>
What happens when you press a key on keyboard..? <br>
How they add numbers.......<br>

Finally i found a book <a href ="http://www.amazon.in/Code-Dv-Undefined-Charles-Petzold/dp/0735611319">Charles Petzold Code</a>
which answers all this questions..

<br>I have to say this is a must read book for any aspiring computer professional..Also any book or video
by this author is Gold
